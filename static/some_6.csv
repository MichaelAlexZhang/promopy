In the late 1890's, Governor Francis P. Fleming suggested that a red cross be added so that it would not appear to be a white flag of truce when hanging still on a flagpole. Some have claimed that the cross is intended to recall the blue saltire of the Confederate Battle Flag. However, this view is not universal and there is no significant opposition to the current design within the state (as there has been in Georgia and Mississippi over their Confederate-style flags). Historically, the first Spanish flag over Florida was a red saltire ragulee (knotted) with a white background (the Burgundian Saltire).",,"http://media.asicdn.com/images/jpgb/24450000/24454303.jpg",,"DECORATIONS,Flags-State/Territorial",,"White-Red","Polyester","Dimension","Length:3:in;Width:5:in","",,,"CHINA",,,,,,,"",,"","","","","","",,,"Y",,"3,5","","",,"","","","",,"","N","",,,,,,"",,,"1",,,,,,,,,,"63.95",,,,,,,,,,"R",,,,,,,,,,,"N/A",,"USD",,"List",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"N",,,,,,"Promotional","N",,,"Y","None",,,,
